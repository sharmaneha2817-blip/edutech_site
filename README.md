# LearnHub - Example EduTech Site

This is a sample, SEO-friendly education website built for hosting on GitHub Pages.

## How to publish
1. Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your GA4 measurement ID in the HTML files.
2. Replace Formspree form action URL in contact.html with your endpoint or use Netlify/Forms.
3. Push the files to a GitHub repo and enable GitHub Pages (branch `main` / `docs` or root).

## Notes
- Tailwind is loaded via CDN for simplicity. For production, consider building CSS.
- Update `example.com` to your actual domain and change canonical URLs.
